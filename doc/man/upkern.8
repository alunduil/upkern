[\fIoptions\fR] \fIkernel\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-c\fR CONFIGURATOR, \fB\-\-configurator\fR=\fICONFIGURATOR\fR
Specifies which configurator should be used to
configure the kernel sources.  The configurator can be
one of the following: config, menuconfig, xconfig,
gconfig, oldconfig, silentoldconfig, defconfig,
${PLATFORM}_defconfig, allyesconfig, allmodconfig,
allnoconfig, randconfig.  All the configurators are
documented in the kernel source files.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR KERNEL_OPTIONS, \fB\-\-options\fR=\fIKERNEL_OPTIONS\fR
This string is literally tacked onto the kernel
options in your boot loader's configuration file.
This is the place you would want to stick a
framebuffer line, or any other options you want your
kernel to have.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR CONFIGURATION, \fB\-\-configuration\fR=\fICONFIGURATION\fR
This specifies the configuration file to load into the
kernel before configuration.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Sets verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Sets debugging output (implies verbose output).
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Sets output to be a bit quieter.  If either debug or
verbose are set this option has no effect.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-rebuild\-modules\fR
Makes ./upkern.py use module\-rebuild to rebuild the
modules you have pulled in via portage for the new
kernel.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR
Times the actual build of the kernel allowing one to
determine if kernels are building faster based on
different aspects of the machine.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Specifies that none of the actions that can modify the
filesystem should occur, but they should be printed to
the screen instead.  This way it can be seen what will
happen without actually doing it.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-remove\fR
Will completely remove the specified kernel from the
system.  This will not remove the sources from the
world file.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information about upkern.
